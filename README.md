# DEX EatTheBlocks

_This project is a decentralized exchange created for trade and create limit orders. Is a DEMO builded thanks to the course EathTheBlocks_

## Starting 🚀

_To run this project locally, you need to have npm and truffle installed._

### Pre-requirements 📋

_You will need to install the next libraries to run this project. For truffle will need to be installed in your machine. The others ones could be installed using only the command npm i_

```
npm install -g truffle
```
```
npm i @openzeppelin/contracts
```
```
npm i @openzeppelin/test-helpers
```

### Installing 🔧

_You can run a simple command to install everything_


```
npm i
```

## Testings ⚙️

_To test the functions from the smart contract._

```
truffle test
```
### What we are testing 🔩

_Is very expensive to deploy and check later if our Smart Contract is working, to avoid this, we test internally all the function that we are going to use._
